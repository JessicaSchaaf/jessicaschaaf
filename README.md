Welcome to my website. Have you ever wondered why you can easily remember where you parked your car one day, but spend minutes on finding it another day? Or why some people are much more affected by a poor nightâ€™s sleep than for others? Such questions keep bothering me and that's why I investigate them. 

I mostly do so through experiments and mathematical modeling. In this way, I can get to the bottom of the processes underlying cognitive capacities like memory, learning, and decision-making.
