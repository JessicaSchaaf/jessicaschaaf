<div style="text-align: justify"> I'm Jessica Schaaf, a postdoctoral researcher interested in how cognitive abilities develop with age and individual differences therein. To understand this, I mostly use experiments in combination with Bayesian computational modeling. Aside from research, I love to do some fun creative science communication.

When my schedule allows it, I'm very happy to start new projects, participate in science communication activities, and consult on data analyses, so please feel free to reach out. </div>
