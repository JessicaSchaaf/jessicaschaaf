Or why some people are much more affected by a poor night’s sleep than for others? Such questions keep bothering me and that’s why I investigate them.\r\nI mostly do so through experiments and mathematical modeling. In this way, I can get to the bottom of the processes underlying cognitive capacities like memory, learning, and decision-making.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Show (2020/2021)\r\n\r\n\r\nI find it important and rewarding to communicate my findings in an understandable manner. As such, I try to come up with fun ways to show the public what I’m working on. Think of infographics, blogs, theater shows, exhibitions, etc.\r\n\r\nTeaching packages and educational videos\r\nTogether with Sophie Hofman and Feline van Aagten from the Lifespan Cognitive Dynamics lab, I developed teaching packages for elementary-school children. These packages include lectures and videos on being a scientist and on the brain, specifically on senses and memory.\r\nBeing a scientist\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brain: Senses\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brain: Memory\r\n\r\n\r\nPopular writing (articles and blogs)\r\nWhen I come across cool papers or news items about (the development of) cognitive performance and/or cognitive fluctuations, I like to write about it. I recently wrote a blog on the importance of science communication and on cognitive fluctuations in the context of the American presidential elections.\r\nI also wrote an article on giftedness in adults for the trade journal De Psycholoog with clinical psychologist Pleun van Vliet. An example of the good things that happen when scientist meets clinician!\r\nParticipation in the Hoe?Zo! Show (2020/2021)\r\nAs a PhD student, I was lucky to participate in the award winning Hoe?Zo! Show, a science theater show for 9- to 10-year-olds developed by Barbara Braams and Lennart de Groot, and presented by Boy Vissers. The goal of the show was to get children excited about science while at the same time teaching the PhD students how to communicate science in an understandable manner. Over 500 children could ask their burning questions which I, together with fellow PhDs from a variety of fields, answered on the spot in a creative and age-appropriate manner. Our season was featured in Trouw and many local news outlets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
